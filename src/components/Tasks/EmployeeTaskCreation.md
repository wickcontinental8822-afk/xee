# Employee Task Creation Feature

## Overview
This feature allows employees to create tasks for themselves, similar to how managers can create tasks. Employees can create tasks in projects they are assigned to, with full control over task details.

## Features Implemented

### 1. EmployeeTaskCreator Component
- **Task Creation Form**: Complete form with all necessary fields
- **Project Dropdown**: Shows only projects assigned to the employee
- **Validation**: Comprehensive form validation with error messages
- **Success Feedback**: Visual confirmation when task is created
- **Loading States**: Proper loading indicators during task creation

### 2. Form Fields
- **Task Title**: Required field for task name
- **Task Description**: Required field for detailed task description
- **Project Selection**: Dropdown showing only assigned projects
- **Priority**: Low, Medium, High priority selection
- **Deadline**: Optional date picker for task deadline

### 3. User Experience Features
- **Collapsible Form**: Form opens/closes with smooth transitions
- **Error Handling**: Clear error messages for validation failures
- **Success Messages**: Confirmation when task is created successfully
- **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop and mobile devices
- **Accessibility**: Proper labels and keyboard navigation

### 4. Security & Permissions
- **Project Restriction**: Employees can only create tasks in assigned projects
- **Self-Assignment**: Employees can only assign tasks to themselves
- **Database Policies**: Row Level Security ensures proper access control
- **Validation**: Frontend and backend validation for security

## Technical Implementation

### Database Schema
The existing `tasks` table supports employee task creation:
```sql
CREATE TABLE tasks (
  id uuid PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  project_id uuid REFERENCES projects(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  title text NOT NULL,
  description text NOT NULL,
  assigned_to uuid REFERENCES profiles(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  created_by uuid REFERENCES profiles(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  status text NOT NULL DEFAULT 'open',
  priority text DEFAULT 'medium',
  deadline timestamptz,
  created_at timestamptz DEFAULT now(),
  updated_at timestamptz DEFAULT now()
);
```

### Database Policies
New migration adds employee task creation policy:
```sql
CREATE POLICY "Employees can create tasks in assigned projects"
  ON tasks
  FOR INSERT
  TO authenticated
  WITH CHECK (
    EXISTS (
      SELECT 1 FROM profiles 
      WHERE profiles.id = auth.uid() 
      AND profiles.role = 'employee'
    )
    AND assigned_to = auth.uid()
    AND EXISTS (
      SELECT 1 FROM projects 
      WHERE projects.id = tasks.project_id 
      AND auth.uid() = ANY(projects.assigned_employees)
    )
  );
```

### Component Integration
- **EmployeeDashboard**: Task creation form integrated into "My Tasks" section
- **DataContext**: Uses existing `createTask` function with proper validation
- **Task Refresh**: Automatic task list refresh after creation
